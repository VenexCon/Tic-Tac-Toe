# Tic-Tac-Toe

<hr> 

<h2> Tac-Tac-What> </h2>

<p> This project was completed as part of The Odin Projects (TOP) full-stack JavaScript course, it focused on OOP and using ES6 syntax. When completeing this project I found that once getting started, alot of the logic and game-flow came naturally, but this still reeled some real challenges and unexpected errors! </p>

<p> This project made me realise that game-design is a whoel different field, and that I didn't find myself as excited as developing front-ends, or UI interaction projects such as the Libary project. Some unexpected errors i ran into during this project </p> 

<ol> 
  <li>Pass by reference vs pass by value</li>
  <li>IIFE's</li>
  <li>the this keyword</li>
  <li>object destructing</li>
</ol>

<p> The idea of keeping variables private and the idea of scope and closures I felt came quite naturally, one issue I did run into was storing the array in one block of code, which didn't become a problem, until the reset feature, as I needed the array to be cleared after every game, or win or reset. This was doable until I wanted the seperate displayController object to also aid in resetting the array. I didn't want to keep using eventlisteners and repeating code, but I found myself having to, in order to get it to work right. In the end I decalred the variable in the global scope and it worked as intended. </p> 

<p> I found myself completeing this project way quicker than expected, I didn't go heavy into DOM manipulation, only becuase I wanted to push on and learn more about classes and composition vs inerhitance. I found that the TOP discord was a great help, and interacting with the community should be done as much as possible! </p> 

<p> I feel like this really helped me understand OOP and why functional programming and pure functions are so important. Debugging certain errors were time consuming and I found myself refactoring quite abit of the code, once I did some research and learnt about more efficient ways of iterating. </p>

<h4> Best Achievement </h4> 

<p> I am really happy that I managed to complete this without looking at alternative solutions on TOP, I am happy that the winner function worked out great, as did the OOP once i wrapped my head around it all. If i was to re-do the project, i would be more tempted to investigate deeper into ensuring all the variables are private instead of having the one straggler. </p>
