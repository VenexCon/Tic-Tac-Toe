Tic-Tac-Toe Log 

We need a Gameboard obj and Player objects (x2); 

Psuedo Code 

// Need a board 
/ Create a 3x3 grid 
/ Create EL for Grid 
/ When clicked, a isAWinner () needs to be called
/ IT should iterate the gameboard and check for a winner
/ current gameboard, needs to be compared against a winning gameboard (array); 
/ if winner the gameboard needs to be cleared and scores logged up to /5; 
/ Board needs to take inputs from players and act as a middle man 
Board should contain the Board, array, winnder function and export actions. 



// players 
/ Each player needs a name Property 
/ Each player needs an assigned token 
/ Each player needs a score counter 
/ scorecounter displayed in DOM
/ The isAWinner() needs to check who placed what pieces in what position
/ iterate over the gameboard and then return nothing if no winner. 
/ if winner, clear gameboard and increment score. 


// Game flow 
/ Keep track of an array 
/ react to other inputs i.e. players actions, gameboard calls and asuch. 


Example 

Player 1 input -> Gamboard takes a parameter, inputs the argument against a comparison array, the array then compares to the winnign array and returns 
If (the player does not win), it then returns the next players go.
